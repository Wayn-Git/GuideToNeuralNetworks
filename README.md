## Introduction to Neural Networks

### What is a Neural Network?
- **Biological Inspiration**: Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains
- **Pattern Recognition**: They excel at finding patterns in complex, non-linear data
- **Learning Capability**: Unlike traditional algorithms, neural networks learn from data without explicit programming
- **Building Blocks**: Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information

### Why Use Neural Networks?
- Solve complex problems where traditional algorithms struggle
- Handle high-dimensional data effectively
- Discover hidden patterns and relationships
- Adapt to new data through learning

## The Architecture of Neural Networks

### Layers Explained

#### Input Layer
- The gateway for data to enter the network
- Each neuron represents a feature from your dataset
- **Example**: For house price prediction, inputs might include:
  - Square footage (1 neuron)
  - Number of bedrooms (1 neuron)
  - Location score (1 neuron)
  - Year built (1 neuron)

#### Hidden Layer(s)
- The "thinking" part of the network
- Perform transformations on the input data
- Multiple hidden layers make the network "deep"
- Each layer can learn different levels of abstraction
- More layers = more complex patterns can be learned

#### Output Layer
- Produces the final prediction or classification
- Structure depends on the problem type:
  - Regression: Often 1 neuron (continuous value)
  - Binary Classification: 1 neuron (probability)
  - Multi-class Classification: Multiple neurons (one per class)

## Components of a Neural Network

### Neurons (Nodes)
- Basic processing units that receive inputs, process them, and pass outputs forward
- Each neuron applies:
  1. A weighted sum of inputs
  2. A bias term
  3. An activation function

### Weights
- Numerical values assigned to connections between neurons
- Determine the strength and influence of each input
- **Key concept**: Learning in neural networks primarily involves adjusting these weights
- Initially randomized, then optimized during training

### Biases
- Additional parameters added to each neuron
- Allow the network to shift the activation function
- Help neurons activate even when all inputs are zeros
- Essential for learning offset patterns in data

### Connections
- Links between neurons that transmit signals
- In feedforward networks, connections only go forward
- Some architectures have connections that skip layers or loop back

## Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing neural networks to learn complex patterns.

### Sigmoid
- Maps values to range (0,1)
- Formula: Ïƒ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
- Useful for output layer in binary classification
- **Drawback**: Suffers from vanishing gradient problem

### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Formula: f(x) = max(0,x)
- Simple and computationally efficient
- Helps solve vanishing gradient problem
- Most commonly used activation in hidden layers
- **Drawback**: "Dying ReLU" problem (neurons that get stuck at 0)

### Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)
- Maps values to range (-1,1)
- Formula: tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))
- Zero-centered, which helps with learning
- **Drawback**: Still has vanishing gradient issues

### Leaky ReLU
- Formula: f(x) = max(Î±x, x) where Î± is a small constant (e.g., 0.01)
- Addresses the "dying ReLU" problem
- Allows small negative values

### Softmax
- Used in output layer for multi-class classification
- Converts values to probabilities that sum to 1
- Emphasizes the highest values while suppressing lower ones

## The Learning Process

### Forward Propagation
- The process of passing input data through the network to get an output
- Step-by-step flow:
  1. Input data enters the network
  2. Each neuron calculates: weighted sum of inputs + bias
  3. Activation function is applied to this sum
  4. Result becomes input for the next layer
  5. Process continues until reaching the output layer

### Loss Function
- Measures how far predictions are from actual values
- Provides the error signal for learning
- Common loss functions:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression problems
    - Formula: (1/n) Î£(y_true - y_pred)Â²
  - **Binary Cross-Entropy**: For binary classification
  - **Categorical Cross-Entropy**: For multi-class classification

### Backpropagation
- The mechanism for neural networks to learn from errors
- Process:
  1. Calculate error using the loss function
  2. Compute how much each weight contributed to the error
  3. Use gradient descent to update weights in the direction that reduces error
  4. Work backwards through layers (hence "back" propagation)

### Gradient Descent
- Optimization algorithm that minimizes the loss function
- Adjusts weights by moving in the direction of steepest descent
- Types:
  - **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses entire dataset per update
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses one sample per update
  - **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Uses small batches of data

### Learning Rate
- Controls how much weights are adjusted during training
- Critical hyperparameter for successful training:
  - **Too small**: Slow convergence, may get stuck in local minima
  - **Too large**: May overshoot optimal values, fail to converge
  - **Just right**: Efficient learning without oscillation
- Learning rate schedules can reduce the rate over time

## Training Vocabulary

### Epoch
- One complete pass through the entire training dataset
- Multiple epochs are typically needed for effective learning
- After each epoch, you can evaluate model performance

### Batch Size
- Number of training examples used in one iteration
- Affects:
  - Memory usage
  - Training speed
  - Learning dynamics
- Common batch sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256

### Iteration
- One update of the model's weights
- Calculation: iterations = dataset_size / batch_size
- Example: With 1000 samples and batch size 10, one epoch = 100 iterations

### Overfitting vs. Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
  - Solution: Regularization, more data, simpler model
- **Underfitting**: Model fails to capture the underlying pattern
  - Solution: More complex model, more training, better features

## Common Neural Network Types

### Feedforward Neural Networks
- Simplest type, information flows in one direction
- Used for: Classification, regression, pattern recognition

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Specialized for processing grid-like data (images)
- Key components: Convolutional layers, pooling layers
- Used for: Image classification, object detection, computer vision

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Process sequential data with internal memory
- Used for: Natural language processing, time series, speech recognition

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Special RNN that solves the vanishing gradient problem
- Can learn long-term dependencies
- Used for: Language modeling, translation, speech recognition

## Practical Implementation Steps

## Simple Practical Example

### Predicting Exam Scores Based on Study Hours

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data: hours studied vs. exam score
hours_studied = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], dtype=float)
exam_scores = np.array([50, 57, 63, 70, 78, 85, 89, 93], dtype=float)

# Normalize data
hours_studied = (hours_studied - np.mean(hours_studied)) / np.std(hours_studied)

# Create a simple model with one hidden layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(4, activation='relu', input_shape=[1]),  # Hidden layer with 4 neurons
    layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer (single value for regression)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Display model summary
model.summary()

# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    hours_studied, 
    exam_scores, 
    epochs=1000, 
    verbose=0
)

# Plot the training progress
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.title('Model Loss During Training')
plt.ylabel('Loss (MSE)')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Make predictions
x_test = np.linspace(-2, 2, 20)
predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_scores, label='Training data')
plt.plot(x_test, predictions, 'r-', label='Predictions')
plt.title('Exam Score Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied (normalized)')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
